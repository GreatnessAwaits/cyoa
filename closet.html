    <h1>Welcome to the Closet</h1>
    <p>*As you walk into the closet you hear a loudspeaker blurt out, Welcome to the Closet, where you make sure that you are wearing clothes!*</p>
    <p>*You walk over to the body mirror on the far side of the wall. You gander into the mirror and realize that you are <em>actually</em> wearing clothes. You are wearing a white T-shirt and a pair of Levi's blue jeans.*</p>
